	The purpose of this lab was to utilize github, classes, templating, and iterators to create a Sudoku game. Once the program is launched, the incomplete sudoku board is displayed. The user is then promped to enter the x and y coordinates and the number they wish to put at those coordinates. If the number and its placement are valid- meaning if it complies with the Sudoku rules, the user will be shown the updated board and be prompted to enter more values. This continues until the user quits the program, or eventually, they will be told that the board has been completely filled. 
	From the programmers perspective, the .txt files used to generate the Sudoku board have been encoded into the program. First, the program reads in the file and uses iterators to create the board. Then, the program prompts the user for input information. The progam required the declaration of template<typename T> before everything that I needed to template. The member functions of the Puzzle class also had to be delcared with "datatype Puzzle<T>::functionName()"The program utilized templating to allow .txt files containing ints or chars to be used for generating the Sudoku board. The program uses a checkPlacement function to make sure that the number is placed into a square that complies with Sudoku rules. The function uses for loops and compares the iterated placement values with the value that the user entered. If the values are the same, the function displays an error message to the user and returns 0. If the value is valid, an updated board game is displayed. Once all the squares are filled, a finished() function will display a message that the board is complete. The progam was verified using a driver program, main.cpp which instantiated a Sudoku object and called necessary functions to play the game. Establishing the iterators to read through the file and create a Sudoku board through it went smoothly for me, but making it able to read in ints and chars was difficult.
